## The Project

This is the project repo for Joe Patrick's project in Data Science (LING 2340). The project is an analysis of dialect features occurring among Serbian and Croatian Wikipedia domains. This project is inspired by Ljubešić, Miličević-Petrović, and Samardžić (2018) which analyzed informal language data on Twitter. Ljubešić et al. collected geo-tagged data based on 16 features known to vary between the variants of the pluricentric language previous referred to as 'Serbo-Croatian.' For the current study, the original 16 features were restricted to 10 in order to capture data accessible via regular expressions. The chosen features represent a variety of linguistic levels, including the lexical and morphosyntactic featuresthat may distinguish Serbian and Croatian varieties of language, whereas phonological differences are largely limited due to difficulty in obtaining the data. 

## The Data

To test out my hypothesis, I made corpora out of five articles taken from Wikipedia. The articles covered the topics of: *Kosovo, Ustaše, Četnici, The Orthodox Church in Montenegro, and Nationalism* and were matched for Serbian and Croatian versions taken from the respective Wikis. Controversial topics were chosen in an effort to determine whether emotionally or socially salient topics evoked more regional or dialectal forms. This is variation on Labov's (1972) 'Danger of Death' question posed during sociolinguistic interviews. Both Ustaše and Četnici are the collective plural names for nationalist parties beginning in World War II but experiencing a resurgence since the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s. The 'Ustaše' are a Croatian wing of nationalism (originating during Croatia's time as a puppet state for the Nazi regime). Similarly, 'Četnici' are the Serbian answer to Croatian (and other Balkan) nationalist groups. Both 'Kosovo' and the 'Orthodox Church in Montenegro' are controversial topics selected to potentially invoke stronger Serbian ideological data. The final topic of 'Nationalism' is intended to evoke any marked data from either language domain.
