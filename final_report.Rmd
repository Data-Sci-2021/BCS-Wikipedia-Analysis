# Introduction

Dialectal variation in language has long been an object of interest for sociolinguists- spanning seemingly disparate fields of linguistics and contributing many of the foundational discoveries of the field. This project takes a limited set of language features commonly understood to distinguish among the varieties of the Western Balkan languages of Former Yugoslavia and applies them to Wikipedia data. The present study was inspired by Ljubešić, N., Miličević Petrović, M., & Samardžić, T. (2018) who look at a set of 16 linguistic features collected from a variety of textbooks and grammars, which represent canonical differences between the languages of Bosnia, Croatia, Montenegro, and Serbia. 



# Background

Language in the Balkans has always been a somewhat divisive issue. As the crossroads between Europe and Asia and the site where two major empires, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman, vied for land and subjects, the resulting identity of the contemporary nations is complicated, to say the least. World War I provoked, among other things, a desire for the disparate South Slavic nations to unite. These states did unite and in doing so, formed the large country of 'Yugoslavia' or 'Land of the South Slavs.' Following a series of wars in the early 1990s, this super state of Yugoslavia found itself disintegrating, with each of its six member states opting to exit the federation and pursue independence. In this effort, a language and culture that was once more unified (at least in theory) became fragmented. The previous moniker for the standard language spoken in this region was no longer appropriate- what is 'Serbo-Croatian' when you suddenly have Bosnians, Bosniaks, Bosnian Serbs, Montenegrins, Montenegrin Serbs, Serbian Montenegrins, et cetera. 

The following two images show quite clearly how the region that was once the single country of Yugoslavia separated into its constituent parts and left behind a complicated social situation of national, ethnic, and linguistic identities:

While most traditional dialectology projects tend to take place 'on the ground' with live speakers in the region of interest, it is impossible to ignore the role of the internet as a communicative medium in the last few decades.

# Data

To test out my hypothesis, I made corpora out of five articles taken from Wikipedia. The articles covered the topics of: * *Kosovo, Ustase, Cetnici, The Orthodox Church in Montenegro, and Nationalism* * and were matched for Serbian and Croatian versions taken from the respective Wikis.

# Method

For this study, data processing was accomplished through the R statistical language using the RStudio interface. Articles comprising the Croatian and the Serbian corpora were collected based on topics likely to evoke regionally standard forms- largely topics covering politically or culturally controversial topics, such as Kosovo, World War II, and specific WWII nationalist parties currently salient in contemporary recreated forms.
